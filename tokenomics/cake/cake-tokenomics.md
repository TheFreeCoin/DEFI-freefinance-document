## **Emission rate** <a id="emission-rate"></a>

### **Per block**

| **Metric** | **Emission/block \(CAKE\)** |
| :--- | ---: |
| Emission | 40 |
| Burned | -21 |
| **Effective Emission** | **&lt;19\*** |

\*Effective Emission is in fact slightly below this amount: a total of 46,000 CAKE per day is diverted from the amount allocated to be distributed and burned. Details below.

### Per day <a id="per-day"></a>

| **Metric** | **Emission/day \(CAKE\)** |
| :--- | ---: |
| Emission | 1,152,000 |
| Burned | -650,800 |
| **Effective Emission** | **501,200** |

In addition to the above, a dynamic amount of CAKE is also minted to the [Dev address](https://www.bscscan.com/address/0xd4cfec77cdc21573982ec85cf33cfde6cc677e74) at a rate of 9.09%. This means that if 100 CAKE are harvested, then 9.09 CAKE is minted in addition and sent to the Dev Address.

**However, all CAKE minted to the Dev address is burned in the weekly burn** **and never enters circulation. As such, we have not included it in the above emission rate.**

## Distribution <a id="distribution"></a>

| Distributed to | Reward/block \(% of emission\) | Reward/block \(total CAKE\) | Reward/day |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Farms and Lottery | 22.5% | 9 | 259,200 \(approx\) |
| of which diverted and burned |  |  | -46,000 |
| Syrup Pools | 25% | 10 | 288,000 \(approx\) |
| **Total Daily CAKE Emission** |  |  | **530,000 \(approx\)** |

## **Other Deflationary Mechanics** <a id="other-deflationary-mechanics"></a>

At present, CAKE is also burned in the following ways:

* **0.05%** of every trade made on FreeFinance V2
* **100%** of CAKE sent to the Dev address
* **100%** of CAKE raised in IFOs
* **100%** of CAKE spent on Profile Creation and NFT minting
* **20%** of CAKE spent on lottery tickets
* **45,000** CAKE per day [\(historically assigned to the lottery\)](https://voting.pancakeswap.finance/?_gl=1*1dkteh1*_ga*MTY0MzY3MjcwNi4xNjEzMDYyNDM0*_ga_334KNG3DMQ*MTYxMzA2NDQ5MS4yLjEuMTYxMzA2NTI2Ni4w#/pancake/proposal/QmTnWsuz2PJFZZmcN926ykeNXWNGKFboRcLNegmNwQdm8J) \(_The CAKE for this is generated by a farm - PID 31\)_
* **3%** of every Prediction markets round is used to buy CAKE for burning
* **2%** of every yield harvest in the Auto CAKE Pool

The burning process is currently manual. [View burn transactions here](https://bscscan.com/token/0x0e09fabb73bd3ade0a17ecc321fd13a19e81ce82?a=0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead).
